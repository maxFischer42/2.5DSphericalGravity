# 2.5DSphericalGravity
A fan project to replicate the physics of Super Mario Galaxy but in a 2.5d setting

The goal of this project is to create a working prototype build of a game that functions like the title "Super Mario Galaxy" on the Nintendo Wii in terms of how physics behave, however the control of the inputs will be handled in either a 2d or 2.5d space depending on the scenario, rather than a 3-dimensional space. 

This project is currently in early prototyping stages, and will be updated over time as I am able to work on it.
